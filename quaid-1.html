            <h3>FAMOUS QUOTES</h3>
            <p>There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a great
                competition and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the Muslim Ideology which has to be preserved,
                which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which, we hope other will share with us
            </p>
            <p>
                My message to you all is of hope, courage and confidence. Let us mobilize all our resources in a
                systematic and organized way and tackle the grave issues that confront us with grim determination and
                discipline worthy of a great nation.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Social media pays rich tribute to Quaid-e-Azam on his 71st death anniversary
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Quaid-e-Azam’s comprehensive vision on the Hindu-Muslim divide led to the creation of a separate
                    homeland, saving millions of Muslims from social injustices. The nation, divided on various lines,
                    stands united in hailing the struggles and sacrifices of Quaid-e-Azam in the creation of
                    Pakistan</b></p>
            <p><b>The nation is paying rich tribute to Pakistan’s founding father Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah on
                    his 71st death anniversary. Social media users posted messages on various platforms commemorating
                    his sacrifices and struggles of achieving a separating homeland for the Muslim population. They
                    recalled Quaid-e-Azam’s determination to establish a truly democratic country, serving equal rights
                    for all its citizens and minorities particularly.</b></p>
            <p><b>His vision has been reinforced with unprecedented popularity following India’s revocation of Article
                    370 and 35-A dissolving the special status of Kashmir, which according to the claims of Pakistan
                    government is a stroke played by the BJP-led Indian government for the ethnic cleansing of the
                    Muslim population in the valley.</b></p>
            <p><b>Quaid-e-Azam was the staunch proponent of two-nation theory, he anticipated the adversaries Muslims
                    would have faced, being the minority, following the withdrawal of British rulers from sub-continent,
                    under Indian rule. Quaid-e-Azam’s apprehensions have resurfaced with the rising religious
                    intolerance towards Muslims in India. Cases of abuse and persecution of the Muslim population have
                    spiked since right-wing Hindu nationalist party BJP has firmly rooted itself in the center.</b></p>
            <p><b>He was a man of his words and the greatest spokesman, he always stood like a rock in front of
                    opponents and never lay down. Gandhi called him “an impossible man ” due to his determinacy over his
                    principles. Jinnah said: “Think a hundred times before you make a decision, but once that decision
                    is taken, stand by it as one man”.In 1930 he became an undisputed leader of all the Muslims of
                    sub-continent and started to lead Muslim League in 1933. In 1940 Pakistan resolution was drafted by
                    Muslim league at Minar e Pakistan -Lahore which has been proved as a backbone in the war of freedom.

                    After the Pakistan Resolution passed, he worked day and night and did not worried about his health
                    which was going down day by day, but he kept it secret and never disclosed it to anyone, his
                    sacrifice was not for his own interest but for the whole Muslim nation. It was due to his wise
                    leadership and vigorous effort that Pakistan came into being on August 14, 1947. He was fighting
                    with tuberculosis for many years but never made it his weakness, died on September 11, 1948, just 13
                    months after the creation of this beloved homeland.</b></p>
